    <string name="atfirstFood">At first, it’s easier for your child to eat foods that are mashed, pureed, or strained and very smooth in texture. It can take time for your child to adjust to new food textures. Your child might cough, gag, or spit up. As your baby’s oral skills develop, thicker and lumpier foods can be introduced. Some foods are potential choking hazards, so it is important to feed your child foods that are the right texture for his or her development. To help prevent choking, prepare foods that can be easily dissolved with saliva and do not require chewing. Feed small portions and encourage your baby to eat slowly. Always watch your child while he or she is eating. Here are some tips for preparing foods: Mix cereals and mashed cooked grains with breast milk, formula, or water to make it smooth and easy for your baby to swallow. Mash or puree vegetables, fruits and other foods until they are smooth. Hard fruits and vegetables, like apples and carrots, usually need to be cooked so they can be easily mashed or pureed. Cook food until it is soft enough to easily mash with a fork. Remove all fat, skin, and bones from poultry, meat, and fish, before cooking. Remove seeds and hard pits from fruit, and then cut the fruit into small pieces. Cut soft food into small pieces or thin slices. Cut cylindrical foods like hot dogs, sausage and string cheese into short thin strips instead of round pieces that could get stuck in the airway. Cut small spherical foods like grapes, cherries, berries and tomatoes into small pieces. Cook and finely grind or mash whole-grain kernels of wheat, barley, rice, and other grains.</string>
    <string name="playing_important">Playing with your baby : why it’s important ?</string>
    <string name="play_is_essential">Play is essential for your baby’s overall development, learning and wellbeing. Through play, your newborn learns about the world around him and how he can interact with it. New play experiences also help parts of your newborn’s brain connect and grow. And play that gets your newborn moving builds muscle strength as well as gross motor skills and fine motor skills. Playing with your newborn helps her learn to talk and understand words. You might not always have time to stop everything and play, but you can still chat to your newborn about what’s going on – for example, while cooking dinner, shopping or folding clothes. Playing together helps you and your newborn get to know each other. That’s because play can tell you a lot about your newborn’s personality. Rough and silly or quiet and calm, you’ll soon know what your newborn likes. Play ideas for newborn babies Playing with your newborn is about the interactions between you and your newborn, not about games and toys. This means that all you need to get started with newborn play is yourself and your baby. Here are some play ideas for newborn babies: Sing, chat, tickle, count toes, blow raspberries – simple things are best for newborns. Babies also love nursery rhymes that involve touch like ‘Round and round the garden’. Sharing nursery rhymes or traditional songs from your own culture and language is great too. Make faces, smile, laugh, roll your eyes or poke out your tongue. Your newborn loves watching your face. Nappy-changing is a great time for face-to-face play. Give your newborn different objects to feel – soft toys, rattles or cloth books with pages of different textures are lots of fun for your newborn. Feeling different things helps your newborn learn about the world. Give your newborn different things to look at – outside, inside, different people or different rooms. Give your newborn tummy time each day. This gives your newborn practice holding up his head and lets him see things from a different point of view. Always watch your newborn during tummy time and put him on his back to sleep. Talk or make sounds with your newborn, and wait for her to respond. It might take a little while but you’ll be surprised at how much your newborn has to ‘say’. This shows your newborn that conversations are about taking turns, listening and responding. Try reading with your baby. It’s never too early to start, but remember to hold the book close – newborns can see only about 20-30 cm in front of them. And remember to enjoy yourselves. It’s only play if it’s fun.</string>
    <string name="keep_him">Keep him hydrated - It\'s important that baby keeps taking breast milk or formula during a fever to avoid dehydration.\n \nDo not stop breast milk - If your baby is breast-feeding, try to nurse more often to prevent dehydration. \n\nGive him a fever reducer as the doctor prescribes - Your doctor might recommend giving your child some baby acetaminophen (or ibuprofen, if your baby is at least 6 months old) to bring down the fever. Never give more than the recommended dosage to your child; her weight will determine the right dose. And always use the measuring device that comes with the medicine to give your baby exactly the right amount. \n\nTry a lukewarm bath - If baby is running a high fever and seems uncomfortable, put him in a lukewarm bath to try to bring his body temperature down. You can also wet some washcloths and give him a sponge bath if you don\'t think he\'s going to react well to being in the tub. Change wet diapers.</string>
    <string name="common_cold_text">Elevate your baby\'s head to help ease breathing - You can do this with a sleep positioner or a firm pillow placed snugly under a fitted sheet. Don’t use anything soft or cushy. \n\nGive plenty of liquids including breast milk Suction out nasal mucus using saline drops and a suction bulb Moisturize the air with a humidifier - Ask your doctor if they recommend a warm or cool mist type. Warm humidifiers may pose a burning risk to older, curious children.</string>
    <string name="stomach_ache_text">Rock your baby - Rocking your baby while he is crying from stomach pain can help your baby pass excess gas. Since crying only causes him to swallow more air which creates more gas, the most important thing is to stop your baby from crying as soon as possible. \n\nChamomile tea - Give your baby some warm chamomile tea (one cup water per teabag). Doctors say that chamomile’s anti-inflammatory properties will help in easing stomach pain as it loosens the muscles of the upper digestive system, relieving along contractions and reducing tummy cramps. \n\nWarm compress - Another way to ease stomach aches is to gently press a warm compress onto your baby’s abdomen when he starts crying due to stomach pain. The procedure can be repeated 2-3 times during the day and night. \n\nMassage using mastard oil - Lay your baby on his back and gently massage the tummy using mustard oil. Apply it around the baby’s navel in an anti-clockwise direction. This will help stimulate the digestive system and move trapped gasses in your baby’s stomach. Massaging your baby every day is quite important. \n\nHelp your baby to burp after every feeding - Burp your baby after every feed by tapping gently on his back, while his head rests on your shoulder. If your baby doesn’t burp easily, try the ‘football hold’. Place him face-down on your forearm, with his legs straddling your elbow. Rest his chin in your hand and apply gentle pressure while stroking his back. This should release the excess air which may have gone inside while feeding.</string>
    <string name="gasand_acidity">Burp your baby - Burping helps relieve gas by allowing air to escape from the body, keeping it from building up.You can try holding your baby upright against your chest. Support her bottom with one hand and gently pat her back with the other. You can also try holding your baby further up on your shoulder so that your shoulder presses against her tummy. This can create a gentle pressure that may help get the burp out. \n \n Massage your baby - Baby massage can also help relieve your baby\'s gas. Sit your tot on your lap and apply a small amount of baby oil to her bare tummy (be on the lookout for any sign of irritation). Place the palm of your hand over her bare tummy. Then, lean baby forward, pressing her tense abdomen against your hand. \n \n Pump the legs back and forth - You can also try to gently push the gas out. While seated, place your baby face up on your lap with her legs toward you and her head resting on your knees. Then, slowly pump baby\'s legs up and down in a bicycle motion. \n \n Give warm bath - Warm water can also help soothe a gassy baby. Draw a warm bath for your little one to help relieve her discomfort and make her feel more relaxed.</string>
    <string name="constipation_text">Increase Water Consumption - Whether your baby is breast or bottle fed, it’s easy to assume she\'s getting enough water due to a primarily liquid diet. If your baby is showing signs of constipatiopn, try giving her an additional 2-4 ounces (1/4-1/2 cup) of water after each feeding to help bowels flush properly. \n \n Offer Fruit Juice - Prune juice has a natural laxative effect, but pear or apple juices also work well to relieve minor constipation. Most babies quickly develop a preference for juice because of how sweet it is, so only offer full strength juices when your little one is constipated. To avoid gassiness, start slowly with less than 2 ounces of juice after feedings. \n \n Feed High-Fiber Foods - Bananas, rice cereal, carrots, and cheese are a mainstay of most infant diets--they also tend to have a binding effect on stool. Foods like apricots, pears, prunes, peaches, and plums are better choices to help avoid constipation. \n \n Give Your Baby “Bicycle Legs” - Sometimes making your baby’s body move will help get his bowels moving, too. Place your baby on his back in front of you. Lift up his legs and move them in a circular motion to mimic the motions of peddling a bicycle. The movement should help to release some abdominal pressure and get things going in the right direction. \n \n Try a Different Brand of formula - If your baby gets formula, sometimes a switch is all it takes to relieve constipation. Every baby reacts differently to the ingredients of each type of formula, so try a few brands to find the one your baby tolerates best. Most brands have a low-lactose option, which your baby may tolerate better. \n \n Take Your Baby\'s Temperature - Rectal stimulation can help your baby’s bowels to move. Use Vaseline to lubricate the tip of a rectal thermometer and insert it into your baby’s bottom. Very gently wiggle JUST the tip a few times before removing it. The stimulation will often cause a bowel movement to occur. \n \n Massage Her Tummy - With your baby on her back, place your hand on her belly button. Using a clockwise motion, massage your baby’s tummy in ever bigger circles. Follow your baby’s cues as to how much pressure to use. If she fusses or cries, you’re pressing too hard. \n \n Give Him a Warm Bath - A warm bath will soothe almost anyone. The thought is that the warm water will help your baby relax, allowing his body to let go of what he’s been holding in. When you’re drying him off is also a perfect time to try the tummy massage technique.</string>
    <string name="hiccups_text">Take a break and burp - Taking a break from a feeding to burp your baby may help get rid of the hiccups, since burping can get rid of excess gas that may be causing the hiccups. Burping will also help because it places your baby into an upright position. \n \n Use a pacifier - Infant hiccups don’t always start from a feeding. When your baby starts to hiccup on their own, try allowing them to suck on a pacifier, as this will help relax the diaphragm and may help stop the bout of hiccups. \n \n Feed the baby gripe water - If your baby seems to be in discomfort because of their hiccups, then you may want to try feeding them gripe water. Gripe water is a combination of herbs and water that is believed by some to help with colic and other intestinal discomforts.</string>
