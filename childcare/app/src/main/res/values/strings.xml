    <string name="atfirstFood">At first, it’s easier for your child to eat foods that are mashed, pureed, or strained and very smooth in texture. It can take time for your child to adjust to new food textures. Your child might cough, gag, or spit up. As your baby’s oral skills develop, thicker and lumpier foods can be introduced. Some foods are potential choking hazards, so it is important to feed your child foods that are the right texture for his or her development. To help prevent choking, prepare foods that can be easily dissolved with saliva and do not require chewing. Feed small portions and encourage your baby to eat slowly. Always watch your child while he or she is eating. Here are some tips for preparing foods: Mix cereals and mashed cooked grains with breast milk, formula, or water to make it smooth and easy for your baby to swallow. Mash or puree vegetables, fruits and other foods until they are smooth. Hard fruits and vegetables, like apples and carrots, usually need to be cooked so they can be easily mashed or pureed. Cook food until it is soft enough to easily mash with a fork. Remove all fat, skin, and bones from poultry, meat, and fish, before cooking. Remove seeds and hard pits from fruit, and then cut the fruit into small pieces. Cut soft food into small pieces or thin slices. Cut cylindrical foods like hot dogs, sausage and string cheese into short thin strips instead of round pieces that could get stuck in the airway. Cut small spherical foods like grapes, cherries, berries and tomatoes into small pieces. Cook and finely grind or mash whole-grain kernels of wheat, barley, rice, and other grains.</string>
    <string name="playing_important">Playing with your baby : why it’s important ?</string>
    <string name="play_is_essential">Play is essential for your baby’s overall development, learning and wellbeing. Through play, your newborn learns about the world around him and how he can interact with it. New play experiences also help parts of your newborn’s brain connect and grow. And play that gets your newborn moving builds muscle strength as well as gross motor skills and fine motor skills. Playing with your newborn helps her learn to talk and understand words. You might not always have time to stop everything and play, but you can still chat to your newborn about what’s going on – for example, while cooking dinner, shopping or folding clothes. Playing together helps you and your newborn get to know each other. That’s because play can tell you a lot about your newborn’s personality. Rough and silly or quiet and calm, you’ll soon know what your newborn likes. Play ideas for newborn babies Playing with your newborn is about the interactions between you and your newborn, not about games and toys. This means that all you need to get started with newborn play is yourself and your baby. Here are some play ideas for newborn babies: Sing, chat, tickle, count toes, blow raspberries – simple things are best for newborns. Babies also love nursery rhymes that involve touch like ‘Round and round the garden’. Sharing nursery rhymes or traditional songs from your own culture and language is great too. Make faces, smile, laugh, roll your eyes or poke out your tongue. Your newborn loves watching your face. Nappy-changing is a great time for face-to-face play. Give your newborn different objects to feel – soft toys, rattles or cloth books with pages of different textures are lots of fun for your newborn. Feeling different things helps your newborn learn about the world. Give your newborn different things to look at – outside, inside, different people or different rooms. Give your newborn tummy time each day. This gives your newborn practice holding up his head and lets him see things from a different point of view. Always watch your newborn during tummy time and put him on his back to sleep. Talk or make sounds with your newborn, and wait for her to respond. It might take a little while but you’ll be surprised at how much your newborn has to ‘say’. This shows your newborn that conversations are about taking turns, listening and responding. Try reading with your baby. It’s never too early to start, but remember to hold the book close – newborns can see only about 20-30 cm in front of them. And remember to enjoy yourselves. It’s only play if it’s fun.</string>
    <string name="keep_him">Keep him hydrated - It\'s important that baby keeps taking breast milk or formula during a fever to avoid dehydration. Do not stop breast milk - If your baby is breast-feeding, try to nurse more often to prevent dehydration. Give him a fever reducer as the doctor prescribes - Your doctor might recommend giving your child some baby acetaminophen (or ibuprofen, if your baby is at least 6 months old) to bring down the fever. Never give more than the recommended dosage to your child; her weight will determine the right dose. And always use the measuring device that comes with the medicine to give your baby exactly the right amount. Try a lukewarm bath - If baby is running a high fever and seems uncomfortable, put him in a lukewarm bath to try to bring his body temperature down. You can also wet some washcloths and give him a sponge bath if you don\'t think he\'s going to react well to being in the tub. Change wet diapers.</string>
